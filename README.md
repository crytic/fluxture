Fluxture is a lightweight crawler for peer-to-peer networks like Blockchains. It currently supports the latest version
of the Bitcoin protocol: 70015. It implements the minimum amount of the Bitcoin protocol necessary to collect geographic
and topological information.

## Quickstart

```commandline
pip3 install fluxture
```

Or, to install from source (_e.g._, for development):

```commandline
$ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/fluxture
$ cd fluxture
$ pip3 install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Usage

To crawl the Bitcoin network, run:

```commandline
fluxture crawl bitcoin --database crawl.db
```

The crawl database is a SQLite database that can be reused between crawls.

## Geolocation

Fluxture uses the MaxMind GeoLite2 City database for geolocating nodes based upon their IP address. Various Fluxture
commands will either require a path to the database, or a MaxMind license key (which will be used to automatically
download the database). You can sign up for a free MaxMind license key,
[here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).

A KML file (which can be imported to Google Maps or Google Earth) can be generated from a crawl using:

```commandline
fluxture kml --group-by ip crawl.db output.kml
```

The geolocation database can be updated from MaxMind by running:

```commandline
fluxture update-geo-db
```

An existing crawl database can be re-analyzed for missing or updated geolocations (_e.g._, from an updated MaxMind database) by running:

```commandline
fluxture geolocate crawl.db
```

## Topological Analysis

Fluxture can calculate topological statistics about the centrality of a crawled network by running:

```commandline
fluxture topology crawl.db
```

## Programmatic Interface

```python
from fluxture.crawl_schema import CrawlDatabase

with CrawlDatabase("crawl.db") as db:
    for node in db.nodes:
        print(f"Node {node.ip}:{node.port} {node.state!s}")
        location = node.get_location()
        if location is not None:
            print(f"\tLocation:\t{location.continent_code}\t{location.country_code}\t{location.city}")
        else:
            print("\tLocation:\t?")
        version = node.get_version()
        if version is not None:
            print(f"\tVersion:\t{version.version!s}")
        else:
            print("\tVersion:\t?")
        print(f"\tOut-Edges:\t{', '.join(str(neighbor.ip) for neighbor in node.get_latest_edges())}")
```
